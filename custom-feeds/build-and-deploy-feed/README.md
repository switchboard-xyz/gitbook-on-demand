# Build and Deploy Feed

This section covers how to create and deploy custom Switchboard data feeds.

### [Build with TypeScript](build-with-typescript.md)

Create and manage feeds programmatically for more complex use cases, CI/CD integration, or dynamic feed generation.

### [Deploy Feed](deploy-feed.md)

Learn how deployment works across Solana/SVM and EVM chains, and what "deploying a feed" means for each.
