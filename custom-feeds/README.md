# Custom Feeds

Create custom data feeds to bring any off-chain data on-chain. Switchboard supports fetching data from REST APIs, DeFi protocols, other oracles, and more.

## Getting Started

Choose your preferred method for creating custom feeds:

### [Feed Builder UI](feed-builder-ui.md)

Use the visual interface to create feeds without writing code. Build, simulate, and publish feed definitions directly from the web app.

### [Building Feeds with TypeScript](custom-feeds-typescript.md)

Create and manage feeds programmatically for more complex use cases, CI/CD integration, or dynamic feed generation.

### [Deploying Custom Feeds](deploying-custom-feeds.md)

Learn how deployment works across Solana/SVM and EVM chains, and what "deploying a feed" means for each.

### [Advanced Feed Configuration](advanced-feed-configuration/README.md)

Deep dive into oracle job structure, task types, and advanced configuration options for power users.
