| **Oracles**         | A blockchain primitive for propagating real-world data on-chain to be used in the context of decentralised applications. Often used in DeFi to price assets where liquidity is fractured between on-chain and off-chain sources.                                                                                                             | N/A                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | N/A                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Push Oracles**    | Broadly used oracles that consistently watch for price movements of curated assets and pushes the responses on-chain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | - No user involvement to propagate prices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | - High cost of constant updates for all transactions, regardless of usage patterns.\<br>- Cost fluctuations can lead to stale data if protocols aren't willing to pay. |
| **Pull Oracles**    | Gaining popularity since 2022, pull oracles use their own data layer to stream data paired with signatures from oracles verifying this data. Protocol users then bring this data on chain themselves when needed.                                                                                                                            | <p>Much cheaper as prices are only posted when the oracle is in use.<br>— Lower fees, meaning more freshness and lower staleness.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | User behaviours relating to data submission may alter user behaviours, which may break certain assumptions made in protocols' design decisions.                        |
| **Secure Enclaves** | Secure Enclaves, or TEEs (trusted execution environments), are a class of hardware that can confidentially and verifiably run a process or an entire virtual machine. Output can emit a quote that confirms that output must have been generated by the binary listed.                                                                       | <p>When running an application inside a secure enclave, the application may emit any output paired with a “quote”<br>These quotes sign the desired output with a unique signing key from within the TEE which can then be verified by any user to confirm that the generated output must have been generated by the binary listed within the quote</p> | N/A                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Enclave Quote**   | A cryptographically signed message that originates from within a secure enclave. Authenticated using the certificate chain of the chip manufacturer and may include data produced by an application operating inside the enclave. Attests that a specific output was indeed generated within a secure and authenticated enclave environment. | A quote serves as a verifiable mechanism to attest that a specific output was indeed generated within a secure and authenticated enclave environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                  | N/A                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **MR\_ENCLAVE**     | Intel's designation for an “enclave measurement”. A signed 32-byte hash that represents the binary or runtime loaded into the trusted execution environment. It serves as a definitive fingerprint of the code executing within the enclave, proving its authenticity and integrity.                                                         | All enclave quotes include an MR\_ENCLAVE value, allowing verification of the specific code that produced a give output and confirms output from an authenticated/untampered code base within a secure enclave.                                                                                                                                        | N/A                                                                                                                                                                    |
