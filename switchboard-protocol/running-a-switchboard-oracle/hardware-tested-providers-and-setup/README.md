# Hardware: tested providers and setup

Switchboard Oracles are designed to provide secure and reliable data within various hardware and provider environments.

The successful operation of these systems hinges on compatibility and performance across multiple platforms.

This section details the specific hardware and technologies that have been rigorously tested to meet these standards.\
**AMD SEV SNP** forms the backbone of the secure computing environments leveraged by Switchboard Oracles.

The following subsections will list the hardware providers and setup that we validated and tested to be working with Switchboard Oracles.

More will be added as we get to validate them first hand.
