# Providing Stake to Switchboard

Providing stake to Switchboard is simple and rewarding! By staking supported assets, you help secure the oracle network while earning SWTCH governance tokens.

## Overview

Switchboard uses [Jito's Node Consensus Network (NCN)](https://www.jito.network/) for its restaking infrastructure. This allows you to stake various LSTs (Liquid Staking Tokens) to secure the Switchboard oracle network and earn SWTCH rewards in return.

**Key Benefits:**
- üèÜ **Earn SWTCH**: Receive governance tokens for network participation
- üîí **Network Security**: Help secure over $5B in DeFi value
- üåê **Multi-Asset Support**: Stake SOL or various LSTs
- ‚ö° **Regular Rewards**: Distributed every Solana epoch (3 days)

To start securing the Switchboard network, you may contribute to the Fragmetric vault for stake to be distributed to oracle operators.

To start staking visit the Fragmetric vault page on the Jito Vault website:

[https://www.jito.network/restaking/vaults/HR1ANmDHjaEhknvsTaK48M5xZtbBiwNdXM5NTiWhAb4S](https://www.jito.network/restaking/vaults/HR1ANmDHjaEhknvsTaK48M5xZtbBiwNdXM5NTiWhAb4S/)

From there you can see the:

* Vault Address
* VRT Mint
* Vault Authority
* Vault website: [https://app.fragmetric.xyz/restake/fragsol](https://app.fragmetric.xyz/restake/fragsol/)

Navigate to the Fragmetric application and stake SOL or any of the fragSOL supported LSTs to start delegating to Switchboard oracles and start earning SWTCH

## What can I stake?

With Jito (re)-staking built in, you can stake any assets your vault supports.

For the Fragmetric Vault, these assets are currently:

* SOL
* JitoSOL
* BNSOL
* mSOL

## How do I earn $SWTCH?

SWTCH is rewarded directly to the vault to be claimable by stakers.

These awards will be distributed every Solana epoch (3 days) and will be viewable on the Fragmetric vault rewards page: [https://app.fragmetric.xyz/rewards/overview/](https://app.fragmetric.xyz/rewards/overview/)

## How Much SWTCH Do I Earn?

The amount to distribute is governed by the Switchboard DAO through [svSWTCH governance](governance-and-tokenomics.md), with the initial year set to distribute 8% of supply to stakers. 

**Reward Calculation:**
- Based on your proportional share of total staked assets
- Distributed from protocol fees and SWTCH subsidies  
- Higher oracle performance = higher rewards for delegators

For complete details on tokenomics and reward distribution, see the [SWTCH Token Overview](swtch-token-overview.md) and [Governance & Tokenomics](governance-and-tokenomics.md) guides.

## How can I unstake?

The unstaking process is controlled by each vault added to the Switchboard NCN.

For the Fragmetric vault, visit [https://app.fragmetric.xyz/unstake](https://app.fragmetric.xyz/unstake/) to initiate the unstake. The unstaking process, like the Solana unstaking process, will take until next epoch to take effect.
