# Governance & Tokenomics

_DeFi is powered by Switchboard. Switchboard is powered by SWTCH._

## Overview

Switchboard operates on a decentralized governance model powered by the SWTCH token, which enables community-driven decision making and economic security through a sophisticated staking and rewards system built on Jito's Node Consensus Network (NCN). The SWTCH token underpins the Switchboard protocol's economy and security, designed to align incentives between all network participants, including oracle node operators, data consumers, and token holders to foster a robust, decentralized, and self-sustaining data ecosystem.

## SWTCH Token

### Purpose & Network Security

* **Governance Participation**: Direct voting power through staked SWTCH (svSWTCH)
* **Economic Security**: Oracle incentive alignment and slashing mechanisms
* **Network Incentives**: Reward distribution and fee collection system
* **Data Access**: Enhanced rate limits and premium product access

## Token Allocation & Vesting

## svSWTCH: Staked Governance Token

### Staking Mechanism

The true power of the SWTCH token is unleashed when it is staked to mint **svSWTCH** (staked-vote SWTCH). This process is facilitated through the **Jito Node Consensus Network (NCN) vault**, where users can delegate their SWTCH. In return, they receive svSWTCH, a staking token that represents their staked position and continuously accrues rewards from protocol activity. Holding svSWTCH is key to accessing the full suite of utilities within the Switchboard ecosystem.

### Core svSWTCH Utilities

#### 1. Decentralized Governance

Holding svSWTCH grants direct voting power over the future of the Switchboard protocol. Key areas of governance include:

* **Node Operations**: Onboarding, performance requirements, and slashing conditions
* **Economic Parameters**: Staking, delegation, and reward parameters
* **Protocol Fees**: Core protocol fee structures and distribution
* **Technical Development**: Priority upgrades and integrations

#### 2. Oracle Incentives & Network Security

To participate in the network and validate data, oracle operators **must have svSWTCH delegated to them**. This "skin in the game" model ensures their incentives are directly aligned with data reliability and network health. The prioritization and workload distribution among oracles are determined by a combination of their performance metrics and the **total svSWTCH delegated to them**. This competitive dynamic rewards high-performing nodes with more work and, consequently, more rewards.

#### 3. Yield via Reward Distribution

Switchboard's economic engine is designed to be self-sustaining through:

1. **Fee Collection**: Network fees (paid in SOL or the chain's native gas token) are collected from every data feed interaction
2. **Rewards Vault**: These fees, supplemented by a SWTCH token subsidy, are deposited into a dedicated protocol rewards vault
3. **Autonomous Distribution**: At the end of each epoch (approximately every 2-3 days), the accumulated assets are distributed. The **Jito NCN vault managers and configurations** are responsible for overseeing this distribution, ensuring rewards are fairly allocated to node operators and individuals who staked SWTCH to receive svSWTCH

#### 4. Enhanced Data Access

Protocols and high-volume users can stake svSWTCH to receive **higher rate limits for data requests**. This tiered access system ensures fair resource allocation, prevents spam, and prioritizes legitimate, high-demand applications that are invested in the protocol's success. svSWTCH holders also unlock free access to **Switchboard Surge**: simply hold the required amount during your subscription and tap into the fastest data feeds in crypto.

## Economic Security Model

### Jito NCN Integration

Switchboard leverages Jito's Node Consensus Network for:

* **Restaking Security**: Additional economic guarantees beyond native staking
* **Validator Coordination**: Synchronized oracle operations across the network
* **Slashing Mechanisms**: Automated punishment for oracle misbehavior

### Incentive Structure

#### Oracle Rewards

* **Base Rewards**: Consistent payments for reliable data provision
* **Performance Bonuses**: Additional rewards for high uptime and accuracy
* **Subsidies**: Protocol-funded support for critical data feeds

#### Staker Benefits

* **Yield Generation**: Share of oracle fees and network rewards
* **Governance Participation**: Influence over network parameters and direction
* **MEV Protection**: Jito NCN provides MEV mitigation for stakers

## Governance Process

### Proposal Lifecycle

1. **Discussion Phase**: Community debate on governance forums
2. **Formal Proposal**: On-chain proposal submission with required stake
3. **Voting Period**: svSWTCH holder voting with specified duration
4. **Execution**: Automatic implementation if proposal passes threshold

### Voting Mechanics

* **Quorum Requirements**: Minimum participation thresholds for valid votes
* **Majority Thresholds**: Different requirements for various proposal types
* **Delegation**: Ability to delegate voting power to trusted representatives

## Cross-Chain Governance

### Multi-Chain Coordination

Switchboard's governance extends across supported blockchains through:

* **Unified Token**: Single SWTCH token across all chains
* **Access Control:** Protocol governance controls access levels to the network related to fees and request limits

### Interoperability Benefits

* **Consistent Policies**: Uniform oracle standards across all networks
* **Shared Security**: Collective economic guarantees for all chains
* **Efficient Capital**: Staking pool secures multiple networks

### Frequently Asked Questions

**What is SWTCH?** SWTCH is the backbone of the economic security model that powers the Switchboard protocol. Designed to secure and incentivize participation in the most decentralized oracle network, SWTCH boosts data reliability and integrity for the fastest feeds in crypto. Today, the Switchboard protocol already secures over $5B in value across 50+ dapps and projects.

**What can I do with my SWTCH?** SWTCH holders can stake their tokens to secure the Switchboard oracle network and enhance data reliability across DeFi. Staking SWTCH mints svSWTCH, which unlocks staking rewards and governance power. For oracle operators, staked svSWTCH represents "skin in the game," backing their feeds and aligning incentives with network integrity.

**Can I use SWTCH to pay for price feeds?** SWTCH can be staked and delegated to oracles within the Switchboard network. High-volume users unlock higher rate limits and premium products like Switchboard Surge with svSWTCH holdings.

**Are my SWTCH tokens transferable immediately?** Additional information about SWTCH allocations, vesting schedules, and transfer restrictions is available in the [Switchboard Foundation docs](https://switchboard.foundation/).
