## Core Utilities

### üó≥Ô∏è Governance Power

* Stake SWTCH to receive svSWTCH (staked-vote SWTCH)
* Vote on protocol parameters, oracle requirements, and network upgrades
* Participate in decentralized decision-making

### üîí Network Security

* Oracle operators must have svSWTCH delegated to participate
* Slashing mechanisms punish bad actors
* Economic alignment between all network participants

### üí∞ Yield Generation

* Earn rewards from oracle fees and network activity
* Distributed through Jito NCN vault system
* Epoch-based reward distribution (every 2-3 days)

### ‚ö° Enhanced Access

* Higher rate limits for data requests with svSWTCH holdings



## Staking Process

1. **Obtain SWTCH**: Claim tokens or acquire through exchanges
2. **Stake via Jito NCN**: Delegate SWTCH through Jito's Node Consensus Network vault
3. **Receive svSWTCH**: Get staked voting tokens that accrue rewards
4. **Participate**: Use svSWTCH for governance and enhanced network access

## Who Should Care About SWTCH?

### Oracle Operators

* **Required**: Must have svSWTCH delegated to participate in the network
* **Competitive Advantage**: More delegation = more work opportunities
* **Aligned Incentives**: Economic stake ensures data quality

### DApp Developers & Protocols

* **Cost Optimization**: Stake for better rate limits instead of higher fees
* **Network Voice**: Governance participation in protocol evolution

### Token Holders & DeFi Users

* **Yield Generation**: Earn yield helping secure the network
* **Governance Participation**: Influence the future of oracle infrastructure&#x20;
* **Cross-Chain Benefits**: Single token securing multiple blockchain networks
