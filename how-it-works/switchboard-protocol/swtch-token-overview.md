## Core Utilities

### 🗳️ Governance Power

* Stake SWTCH to receive svSWTCH (staked-vote SWTCH)
* Vote on protocol parameters, oracle requirements, and network upgrades
* Participate in decentralized decision-making

### 🔒 Network Security

* Oracle operators must have svSWTCH delegated to participate
* Slashing mechanisms punish bad actors
* Economic alignment between all network participants

### 💰 Yield Generation

* Earn rewards from oracle fees and network activity
* Distributed through Jito NCN vault system
* Epoch-based reward distribution (every 2-3 days)

### ⚡ Enhanced Access

* Higher rate limits for data requests with svSWTCH holdings

## Staking Process

1. **Obtain SWTCH**: Claim tokens or acquire through exchanges
2. **Stake via Jito NCN**: Delegate SWTCH through Jito's Node Consensus Network vault
3. **Receive svSWTCH**: Get staked voting tokens that accrue rewards
4. **Participate**: Use svSWTCH for governance and enhanced network access

## Who Should Care About SWTCH?
