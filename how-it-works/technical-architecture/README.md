# Switchboard’s Architecture, Tech Stack and Security

Switchboard operates as a decentralised oracle network, delivering reliable and transparent data feeds to blockchain applications. Several core components underpin Switchboard's functionality and security, these include:

* [**Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)**](trusted-execution-environments-tees.md)**:** Providing secure enclaves for code execution and data integrity.
* [**Oracle Queues:**](oracle-queues.md) Managing and securing data feeds through structured environments.
* [**Node Architecture:**](node-architecture.md) Distributing tasks across a network of specialised nodes, with Guardians ensuring security through ongoing review and validation of new Oracles and Guardians
