# Introduction

Switchboard is the most **fast**, **customizable**, and **permissionless** way to bring data on-chain.

We're the go-to data provider for prominent DeFi projects such as [Kamino](https://kamino.com/), [Jito](https://www.jito.network/), [MarginFi](https://app.marginfi.com/), and [Drift](https://www.drift.trade/). We secure billions of dollars of on-chain volume, process hundreds of millions of requests weekly, and deliver real-time information for hundreds of projects and assets across 10+ blockchains.

The Switchboard Protocol is open-source and contributions are welcome. Need help using Switchboard? Our support team is available around the clock on Discord.
