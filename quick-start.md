# Quick Start

* Learn how to use a Switchboard price feed in your on-chain application on [Solana](docs-by-chain/solana-svm/price-feeds/basic-price-feed.md), [EVM](docs-by-chain/evm/price-feeds/price-feeds-tutorial.md), or other chains.

* Explore Surge, the industry's fastest oracle data stream, on [Solana](docs-by-chain/solana-svm/surge/README.md), [EVM](docs-by-chain/evm/surge/README.md), or [Sui](docs-by-chain/sui/surge/README.md).

* Generate verifiably fair randomness for games, lotteries, and more on [Solana](docs-by-chain/solana-svm/randomness/randomness-tutorial.md) or [EVM](docs-by-chain/evm/randomness/randomness-tutorial.md).

* Browse through thousands of existing data feeds on [our explorer site](https://explorer.switchboardlabs.xyz).

* Can't find an existing feed that does what you need? Learn how to make and use a [custom data feed](custom-feeds/README.md) with infinite customization possibilities.


* Dive into how the [Switchboard protocol](how-it-works/switchboard-protocol/README.md) works.
