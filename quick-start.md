# Quick Start

### Learn to use Switchboard Data Feeds:

* Learn how to use a Switchboard price feed in your on-chain application on [Solana](docs-by-chain/solana-svm/price-feeds/basic-price-feed.md), [EVM](docs-by-chain/evm/price-feeds/price-feeds-tutorial.md), or other chains.

* Explore **Surge**, the industry's fastest oracle data stream, on [Solana](docs-by-chain/solana-svm/surge/README.md), [EVM](docs-by-chain/evm/surge/README.md), or [Sui](docs-by-chain/sui/surge/README.md).

* Generate verifiably fair randomness for games, lotteries, and more on [Solana](docs-by-chain/solana-svm/randomness/randomness-tutorial.md) or [EVM](docs-by-chain/evm/randomness/randomness-tutorial.md).
### Explore existing feeds or create your own:
* Browse through thousands of existing data feeds on [our explorer site](https://explorer.switchboardlabs.xyz).

* Can't find an existing feed that does what you need? Learn how to make and use a [custom data feed](custom-feeds/README.md) with infinite customization possibilities.
### Go Deeper
* Are you a power user that needs the fastest price updates and lots of queries? Learn how to set up a [Crossbar server](tooling/crossbar/README.md).
* Dive into the [protocol](how-it-works/switchboard-protocol/README.md) and [technology](how-it-works/technical-architecture/README.md) that power Switchboard.
