# Why Switchboard?

* **Fastest Oracle Updates**
  * In the world of DeFi, faster price updates directly translate to higher returns for your on-chain applications.
* **Low Costs**
  * With On-Demand Oracles, data feeds can be created and used only when required. This eliminates the need for constant data streaming and _significantly_ reduces your latency and costs.
* **Deploy and Customize Without Permission**
  * Deploy your new data feed, stream from any source on or off-chain, and set the exact parameters that your project needs. No need to wait for contracts, approvals, or red tape.
* **Security and Privacy**
  * Switchboard prevents anyone, including node operators, from altering, exposing or frontrunning your data. Running inside Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), your code stays safe and secure.&#x20;
