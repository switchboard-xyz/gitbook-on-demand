# Introduction

Switchboard is the most **fast**, **customizable**, and **permissionless** way to bring data on-chain.

We're the go-to data provider for prominent DeFi projects such as [Kamino](https://kamino.com/), [Jito](https://www.jito.network/), [MarginFi](https://app.marginfi.com/), and [Drift](https://www.drift.trade/). We secure billions of dollars of on-chain volume, process hundreds of millions of requests weekly, and deliver real-time information for hundreds of projects and assets across 10+ blockchains.

## Why Switchboard?

We've deeply studied the blockchain oracle market and found that none of the current offerings can serve as a one-size-fits-all solution. Some prioritize pricing fidelity, others focus on risk management, and some emphasize flexibility. By closely observing the market, we designed our technology to address the persistent and important issues that oracle users face.

Our protocol is designed around 4 main principles:

* **Fastest Oracle Updates**
  * With latencies of 2-5ms with Surge, or 400ms with our standard oracles, no one beats Switchboard's speeds. In the fast-paced world of DeFi, faster price updates directly translate to increased security and higher returns for your on-chain applications.
* **Low Costs**
  * With pull feeds, feeds can be created and used only when required. This eliminates the need for constant data streaming and _significantly_ reduces your latency and costs.
* **Permissionless and Flexible**
  * Deploy your new data feed, stream from any source on or off-chain, and set the exact parameters that your project needs. No need to wait for contracts, approvals, or red tape.
* **Secure and Private**
  * Switchboard prevents anyone, including node operators, from altering, exposing or frontrunning your data. Running inside Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), your code stays safe and secure.

The Switchboard Protocol is [open-source](https://github.com/switchboard-xyz) and contributions are welcome. Need help using Switchboard? Our support team is available around the clock on [Discord](https://discord.gg/switchboardxyz).
