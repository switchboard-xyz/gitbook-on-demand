# Price Feeds

Access to reliable, real-world data is essential for smart contracts and decentralised applications (dApps) to operate effectively, particularly in Decentralised Finance (DeFi). Real-time asset prices, forming the backbone of any DeFi protocol, are among the most critical data points. If you are developing solutions from lending platforms to stablecoins, your application will fundamentally rely on a trustworthy and timely source of price information from an oracle.

This is where Data Feeds come in. Think of them as secure bridges connecting the off-chain world of financial markets to your on-chain smart contracts. They provide a continuous stream of verified, aggregated price data for a wide range of assets, enabling your dApp to react to market fluctuations and operate correctly.
