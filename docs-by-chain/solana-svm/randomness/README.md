# Randomness

Verifiable randomness is essential for applications that require unpredictable, tamper-proof random values. From gaming and NFT mints to lotteries and fair selection mechanisms, on-chain randomness enables trustless outcomes that neither users nor developers can manipulate.

Switchboard provides cryptographically secure randomness that is verifiable on-chain, ensuring transparency and fairness for your decentralised applications.
