# Introduction

## Switchboard: _The_ Everything Oracle.

It's not just another oracle; it's the fastest, most customisable and _only_ permissionless oracle protocol out there. Trusted by leading decentralised applications, Switchboard offers unparalleled data access across multiple blockchains.

Switchboard allows any decentralised application access to:

* [**A Vast Data Feed Library & Custom Feeds:**](https://ondemand.switchboard.xyz/solana/mainnet) Choose from thousands of existing price and data feeds, or effortlessly create your own – permissionlessly.
* [**Built-in Oracle Aggregator:**](https://ondemand.switchboard.xyz/aggregator) Easily access and aggregate data from multiple oracle providers, including Chainlink and Pyth, within a single feed for the best price discovery and automatic redundancy.
* [**Randomness**](../../product-documentation/randomness/)**:** Generate provably fair and fast randomness using trusted execution environments – Crucial for creating provably fair games, transparent lotteries, reliable prediction markets, and generally ensuring unbiased outcomes.
* [**Community Governance:**](../../switchboard-protocol/governance-and-tokenomics.md) Participate in decentralized governance through SWTCH token staking, helping secure the network while earning rewards and shaping the future of oracle infrastructure.

The Switchboard Protocol is [open-source](https://github.com/switchboard-xyz) and contributions are welcome. Our support team is available around the clock on [Discord](https://discord.gg/switchboardxyz).
